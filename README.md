# Recycling-App
Recycling App For SigmaHacks 3

Description:
  Our idea for our app was to create a recycling tracker where you could log daily/weekly/monthly your positive impact on the environment by recycling. The goal was to educate users as well as to encourage them to recycle more as it's important to let the user know how important they are in the process of cleaning up our planet. All of us had never coded in Swift before but it was an amazing learning experience and got us all excited for future IOS app projects that we will be pursuing.

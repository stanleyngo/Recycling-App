# Recycling-App
Recycling App For SigmaHacks 3

Description:
  Our idea for our app would be to create a recycling tracker where you could log daily/weekly/monthly your positive impact on the environment by recycling. The goal was to educate users as well as promote them to recycle more as its important to let the user know how important they are in the process of cleaning up our planet. All of us here had never coded in swift before but it was an amazing learning expereince and got us all excited for future ios app projects that we will be pursuing.
